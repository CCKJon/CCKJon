  Hello 👋 Jonathan here 
  <br/>
  </h1>

I'm a passionate Full-Stack Developer with a strong emphasis on Front-End technologies. 
Crafting elegant and efficient solutions is my passion, and I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and share it with others.
Over my professional experiences, I've found a love for SvelteKit, a front-end framework that captivates me with its simplicity and incredible ability to overcome the limitations of React and Next.js. I believe in the power of clean and intuitive code to deliver exceptional user experiences, and SvelteKit perfectly aligns with this philosophy.

Let me give you a glimpse of my diverse skill set:

* **Languages |** JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS
* **Front-End |** Svelte, SvelteKit
* **Back-End |** FastAPI, MongoDB
* **Tools |** Git, VS Code
